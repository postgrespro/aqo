 * aqo.h
 *		Adaptive query optimization extension
 *
 * Adaptive query optimization is the kind of query optimization in which
 * the execution statistics from previously executed queries is used.
 * Adaptive query optimization extends standard PostgreSQL cost-based query
 * optimization model.
 * This extension uses machine learning model built over the collected
 * statistics to improve cardinality estimations.
 *
 * The extension organized as follows.
 *
 * Query type or query hash is an integer number. Queries belongs to the same
 * type if they have the same structure, i. e. their difference lies only in
 * their constant values.
 * The settings of handling for query types are contained in aqo_queries table.
 * Examples of query texts for different query types are available in
 * aqo_query_texts table.
 * Query types are linked to feature spaces.
 *
 * Feature space is the set of machine learning models and their settings
 * used for cardinality prediction. The statistics of query types from one
 * feature space will interact. This interaction may be constructive or
 * destructive, which leads to performance improvement or performance
 * degradation respectively.
 * Feature spaces are described by their hashes (an integer value).
 *
 * This extension presents four default modes:
 * "intelligent" mode tries to automatically tune AQO settings for the current
 * workload. It creates separate feature space for each new type of query
 * and then tries to improve the performance of such query type execution.
 * The automatic tuning may be manually deactivated for some queries.
 * "learn" mode creates separate feature space and enabled aqo learning and
 * usage for each new type of query. In general it is similar to "intelligent"
 * mode, but without auto_tuning setting enabled by default.
 * "forced" mode makes no difference between query types and use AQO for them
 * all in the similar way. It considers each new query type as linked to special
 * feature space called COMMON with hash 0.
 * "controlled" mode ignores unknown query types. In this case AQO is completely
 * configured manually by user.
 * "disabled" mode ignores all queries.
 * Current mode is stored in aqo.mode variable.
 *
 * User can manually set up his own feature space configuration
 * for query types by changing settings in table aqo_queries.
 *
 * Module preprocessing.c determines how to handle the given query.
 * This includes following questions: whether to use AQO for this query,
 * whether to use execution statistics of this query to update machine
 * learning models, to what feature space the query belongs to, and whether
 * this query allows using intelligence autotuning for three previous questions.
 * This data is stored in aqo_queries table. Also this module links
 * new query types to their feature spaces according to aqo.mode.
 *
 * If it is supposed to use AQO for given type of query, the extension hooks
 * cardinality estimation functions in PostgreSQL. If the necessary statistics
 * for cardinality predictions using machine learning method is available,
 * the extension performs the prediction and returns its value. Otherwise it
 * refused to predict and returns control to standard PostgreSQL cardinality
 * estimator.
 * Modules cardinality_hooks.c and cardinality_estimation.c are responsible
 * for this part of work.
 *
 * If it is supposed to use execution statistics of given query for learning
 * models in AQO, the extension sets flag before execution to collect rows
 * statistics. After query execution the collected statistics is proceed in
 * the extension and the update of related feature space models is performed.
 * Module postprocessing.c is responsible for this part of work.
 * Also it saves query execution time and cardinality qualities of queries
 * for further analysis by AQO and DBA.
 *
 * Note that extension is transaction-dependent. That means that user has to
 * commit transaction to make model updates visible for all backends.
 *
 * More details on how cardinality estimation and models learning works.
 *
 * For each node we consider it induced feature subspace. Two nodes belongs
 * to the same feature subspace if their base relations are equal, their
 * clause sets are similar (i. e. their clauses may differ only by constant
 * values), and their classes of equivalence with size more than two are common.
 *
 * For each feature subspace we consider the selectivities of clauses which are
 * not in one of three-or-more-variables equivalence class as features of the
 * node. So each node is mapped into real-valued vector in the unit hypercube.
 * So our statistics for feature subspace is a set of such vectors with true
 * cardinalities of their corresponding nodes.
 *
 * That is how we state machine learning problem: we build the regressor from
 * each feature subspace (i. e. from clause selectivities) to cardinality.
 * More precisely, we regress vector of logarithms of clause selectivities to
 * logarithm of cardinality (that was done to set the scale which is  suitable
 * to the problem semantics and to the machine learning method). To aviod -infs
 * we lower bounded logarithms of cardinalities with 0 and logarithms of
 * selectivities with -30.
 *
 * The details of the machine learning method are available in module
 * machine_learning.c.
 *
 * Modules path_utils.c and utils.c are described by their names.
 *
 * Module hash.c computes hashes of queries and feature subspaces. The hashes
 * fulfill the properties described below.
 *
 * Module storage.c is responsible for storage query settings and models
 * (i. e. all information which is used in extension).
