-- AQO needs to predict total fetched tuples in a table.

-- At a non-leaf node we have prediction about input tuples - is a number of
-- predicted output rows in underlying node. But for Scan nodes we don't have
-- any prediction on number of fetched tuples.
-- So, if selectivity was wrong we could make bad choice of Scan operation.
-- For example, we could choose suboptimal index.
-- Turn off statistics gathering for simple demonstration of filtering problem.
